Rcam2x is an updated version of [Rcam2](https://github.com/keijiro/Rcam2).
Although the basic concepts are unchanged from the original version, it contains several fixes and modifications:

- Unity version update
- Device changes (iPad Pro -> iPhone Pro Max)
- UI updates
- Depth calculation fixes
- Improved third-person view mode
- VFX redesign
- Background VFX
- Etc.

I used this version in a live performance with Yousuke Yukimatsu at [HEART ATTACK 心臟爆擊](https://tripper.kktix.cc/events/heartattack), Taipei, 24th Dec 2022.
